# MoshMate_v1

This app is meant to help the user find points of interest on a map.
Originally the idea was thought of as a way for a user to find their friends in the middle of a packed moshpit at a music festival. Often you can get separated from friends due to bathroom breaks, different schedules etc, so the idea would be to drop a pin in this app to meet at a certain point.
Once a location on the app is selected, an arrow will appear with haptic and visual feedback depending on the user's orientation and distance from targe.
